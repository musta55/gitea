# Student Guide — Running Gitea Locally

Welcome! This is a course fork of [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/), a self-hosted Git service
written in **Go** (backend) and **Vue/TypeScript** (frontend). You'll be improving the kind of tool
you use every day — issues, pull requests, code review, CI/Actions.

This guide gets you from a fresh clone to a running Gitea on your machine, backed by **SQLite** (no
separate database server needed). It should take ~15–30 minutes, most of which is the first backend
compile.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Install these before you start. Versions below are the minimums this fork is pinned to.

| Tool | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Go** | **1.26.4+** | Backend. `go.mod` requires `go 1.26.4`. |
| **Node.js** | **22.18.0+** | Frontend build only (not needed at runtime). |
| **pnpm** | **11.0.0+** | Frontend package manager. Easiest via `corepack enable`. |
| **Git** | 2.x | Required both to build **and at runtime** (Gitea shells out to git). |

**You do NOT need a C compiler (gcc).** This version of Gitea uses a pure-Go SQLite driver
(`modernc.org/sqlite`) and builds with `CGO_ENABLED=0`, so there's no MSYS2/MinGW/Xcode-tools step.
This is the main reason setup is painless on Windows.

**Optional:** `make` (convenience only — every command below also has a no-`make` form), and Docker
(if you'd rather run the official container instead of building).

### Installing the toolchain
- **Windows:** `winget install GoLang.Go` and `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS`, then `corepack enable`.
- **macOS:** `brew install go node` then `corepack enable`.
- **Linux:** use your package manager (or the official Go tarball) for Go + Node, then `corepack enable`.

Verify:
```bash
go version      # go1.26.x
node --version  # v22.18+ (or newer)
pnpm --version  # 11.x
git --version
```

---

## 2. Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/musta55/gitea.git
cd gitea
```

---

## 3. Build

Gitea is built in two halves: the frontend assets (with pnpm/vite) and the backend binary (with Go).

### Option A — with `make` (recommended if you have it)
```bash
make build          # builds frontend + backend into ./gitea (or gitea.exe on Windows)
```

### Option B — without `make` (works everywhere)
```bash
# 1) frontend assets -> public/assets/
pnpm install
pnpm exec vite build

# 2) backend binary  (pure-Go SQLite, no gcc)
#    Linux/macOS:
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o gitea .
#    Windows (PowerShell):
$env:CGO_ENABLED=0; go build -buildmode=exe -o gitea.exe .
```

> The first backend compile takes a few minutes and produces a ~100+ MB binary. Later builds are fast.

## 4. Run (SQLite, zero config)

Just start the web server from the repo root and let the built-in installer set everything up:

```bash
# Linux/macOS:
./gitea web
# Windows:
./gitea.exe web
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** and you'll see the **Install** page:

1. **Database Type:** choose **SQLite3** (the default path is fine).
2. Leave the rest at defaults for local dev.
3. Expand **Administrator Account Settings** and create your admin username / password / email
   (do this now so you don't have to register separately).
4. Click **Install Gitea**.

That's it — you now have a running Gitea with a SQLite database at `data/gitea.db`. Log in with the
admin account you just created.

> **Port already in use?** If something else owns `:3000`, start Gitea on another port:
> `./gitea web --port 3030` and open http://localhost:3030 instead.

### Live-reload while developing (optional)
If you have `make`:
```bash
make watch          # rebuilds frontend + backend on file changes (uses air)
```

---

## 5. Try it out

Create a repository (with "Initialize repository"), open an issue, push a branch, and open a pull
request so you can see the code-review UI. These are the areas most course tasks touch:

- **Code review UI** — the diff viewer and PR review flow.
- **Issues / Kanban** — issue tracking and project boards.
- **CI / Actions** — the built-in Actions runner and workflow UI.

---

## 6. Running the tests

Gitea's test suite is validated on **Linux CI**. Run it on Linux, macOS, WSL2, or the provided
`.devcontainer` — **not native Windows**, where a handful of unit tests fail for platform reasons
(symlink semantics, temp-file cleanup) rather than real bugs.

```bash
# unit tests
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test ./...
# or, with make:
make test-backend         # unit tests
make test-integration     # integration tests (defaults to SQLite via GITEA_TEST_DATABASE)
```

Frontend tests:
```bash
pnpm exec vitest run
```

## 7. Common gotchas

- **`git` not found at runtime:** Gitea runs git commands for every repo operation. Make sure `git`
  is on your `PATH`, not just in your IDE.
- **`go build` is slow the first time:** normal — it compiles ~3000 packages once, then caches.
- **Don't commit build artifacts:** `gitea`/`gitea.exe`, `data/`, `custom/`, and `public/assets/*`
  are gitignored. Keep them out of your commits.
- **Windows line endings:** the repo expects LF. Your editor/`.gitattributes` should keep it that way.
